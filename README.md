# Portfolio
This is version 2 of my porfolio site- check out version one [here](https://github.com/cjwe/portfolio-website). <br> My goal with this update was to refine the ideas I had in version one, without straying too far from the original design. I wanted to build a single page portfolio while also keeping the feature of the active links in the navigation bar. To solve this, I added some JavaScript to set different classes as active, which reveals the now active class through CSS transitions. If you're interested in the method, check out [this tutorial](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-animations-scroll/) by Oscar Jite.
